One function of an operating system is that its has the ability to turn off and turn on a device.
meaning if you need to use a certain device the operating system in that device has the capacity to turn it on.
The operating system in that device also has the capacity to turn off the device, so if you dont want the device to waste energy you can 
turn it off.
Another thing an operating system can do is establish an internet connection to your device.
Meaning your dive will have access to the internet and your be able to surf the web. 
Haveing an internet connection is good because you are able to look up information about almost anything that is online.
What an operationg system can also do is manage different programs on your device. 
what it can do is have multiple apps running that way you dont have to close an app in order to open a new one.
This is good because say you need one app to write things down and on the other app its showing you what you need to read to take notes 
from. these are some of the thing that an operating system is able to do on your device.
